# connectForm()

`connectForm()` is a convenient method, using HoC to provide form view into React component. This resembles Redux's `connect()` method.

This approach is used in "Examples", however you can always use `createForm()` if you don't like HoC.

### API: connectForm(ReactComponent, formConfig, initData)

Please check the "Examples" page for samples of `connectForm()`
